### A Platform for Political Education and Opinion Development
<img width="910" src="https://github.com/SpyrexDE/polymo/assets/57133330/4bace05a-fdd4-400a-a8dd-567987e3f81a">


Polymo is an innovative online platform designed to facilitate political education and foster the development of informed opinions on various political topics. With a structure similar to Wikipedia, Polymo offers a comprehensive collection of entries, each focusing on specific topics such as "Climate Change" or "School System".

Within the Climate Change topic, users may encounter thought-provoking suggestions that provoke further exploration and discussion. For instance, users may come across suggestions like "Implement carbon pricing policies" or "Invest in renewable energy infrastructure".

By delving deeper into these suggestions, users can access comprehensive lists of pro and contra arguments associated with each proposal. These arguments aim to present a balanced viewpoint on the topic, encouraging users to consider different perspectives. For example, a con argument for the suggestion "Implement carbon pricing policies" could be "Potential burden on low-income households", while a pro argument for the same suggestion might be "Incentivizes companies to reduce carbon emissions".

One of the key features of Polymo is its intuitive drag-and-drop interface, allowing users to individually evaluate and assess the pro and contra arguments associated with each suggestion. This interactive feature empowers users to weigh the merits of each argument and form their own opinions based on critical thinking and personal judgment.

## Content Creation and Moderation

In terms of content creation and moderation, Polymo draws inspiration from Wikipedia's collaborative model. Users are encouraged to contribute by adding new topics, suggestions, and arguments, while also ensuring the quality and accuracy of the content through a community-driven moderation system.

## Project Goals

The goals of Polymo are as follows:

1. Provide a platform for political education and opinion development.
2. Present topics, suggestions, and arguments in a structured and accessible manner.
3. Enable users to evaluate pro and contra arguments individually through a drag-and-drop interface.
4. Foster critical thinking, diverse perspectives, and informed decision-making.
5. Encourage user contributions and maintain content quality through community-driven moderation.

With Polymo, individuals can enhance their understanding of political issues, gain exposure to diverse perspectives, and develop well-informed opinions. By promoting active engagement and critical thinking, the platform aims to empower users to participate effectively in political discussions and make informed decisions in a democratic society.

**Note:** This project Is still in its early stages and looks for contributors and financial support.
